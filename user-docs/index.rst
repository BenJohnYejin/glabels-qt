gLabels User Manual
===================

The *gLabels* application is a lightweight program for creating labels and business cards for the GNOME desktop environment. It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label and business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply stores.

*gLabels* can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags, cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a regular pattern on a sheet of paper. Labels (or cards) can contain text, images, lines, shapes, and barcodes. gLabels also includes a document-merge feature which lets you print a unique label for each record from an external data source, such as a CSV file.
