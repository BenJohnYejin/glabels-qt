gLabels Label Designer is a GUI program for designing and printing labels and
business cards.  It is designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off
label and business card sheets that youâ€™ll find at most office supply stores.

gLabels can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags,
cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a regular
pattern on a sheet of paper.  Labels (or cards) can contain text, images, lines,
shapes, and barcodes.  gLabels also includes a simple document-merge
feature which lets you print a unique label for each record from an external
data source, such as a CSV file.

.. note:: In the following chapters a lot of screenshots from gLabels will be shown.  As gLabels runs on many different platforms with many different window managers with different themes applied, your screen might look different from the provided screenshots.  As there will be no real differences in functionality of gLabels between environments, these screenshots should still be understandable.
