Starting gLabels
----------------

You can start gLabels Label Designer from the command line or from a window manager.


From the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start gLabels from the command line, simply type:

.. code-block:: console
  
  $ glabels-qt

To start gLabels with an existing gLabels project file, simply type the filename after ``glabels-qt`` as in this example:

.. code-block:: console
  
  $ glabels-qt my-project.glabels

To see a full list of command line options, simply type:

.. code-block:: console
  
  $ glabels-qt --help


From a Window Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: As gLabels runs on many different platforms with many different window managers, the exact process to start gLabels will differ.

Generally, you will be looking for a *Start* or *Applications* menu item or icon to click on, as illustrated below:

.. figure::  figures/starting-examples.png
   :align:   center

You may also be able to start gLabels with an existing gLabels project file, by navigating to that file in your file manager and clicking it, double-clicking on it, or activating an ``Open with ...`` context menu item.


Welcome Window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When started without a project file, gLabels will present the following simplified startup (or "Welcome") window.  In the center of this window are shortcut buttons that allow you to :ref:`create a new project <create-new>` or :ref:`open an existing one <opening>`.

Once a project is created or opened, this window will be reconfigured to include the full :ref:`gLabels interface <interface>`.
