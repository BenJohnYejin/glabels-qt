Starting gLabels
----------------

You can start gLabels Label Designer from the command line or from a window manager.

To start the gLabels from the command line, simply type: ``glabels-qt``.  To see a full list of command line options, simply type: ``glabels-qt --help``.

As gLabels runs on many different platforms with many different window managers, the exact process to start gLabels will differ.  Generally, you will be looking for a menu item or icon to click on, as illustrated below:

Once started, gLabels will present the following startup (or "Welcome") screen.  From this screen, you can create a new project or open an existing one.
